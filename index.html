Specific
What do you want to accomplish?
Why is this goal important?
Who is involved?
Where will it take place?
What resources or limits are involved?

Measurable
How much?
How many?
How will you know when it is accomplished?

Achievable
How can the goal be accomplished?
What are the logical steps to take?
Is it realistically achievable given your current resources and constraints?

Relevant
Does this seem worthwhile?
Is this the right time?
Does this match your other efforts/needs?
Are you the right person to reach this goal?
Is it applicable in the current environment?

Time-bound
When do you want to accomplish this goal?
What can you do today?
What can you do six weeks from now?
What can you do six months from now?

  Example:    

SMART Goal: "For the next three months, I will brush my teeth twice daily, once after breakfast and once before going to bed, to improve my oral hygiene. I will track my progress using a calendar app to ensure I adhere to this routine daily."

Specific: The individual will brush their teeth twice a day, once in the morning and once before going to bed.
Measurable: Progress can be measured by tracking daily brushing on a calendar or a mobile app.
Achievable: The goal is realistic and achievable, considering that it involves a routine task that does not require excessive time or resources.
Relevant: This goal is relevant to the individualâ€™s overall self-care and oral hygiene, which is an important part of personal health.
Time-bound: The individual will aim to consistently follow this routine for a period of three months, after which they will reassess their habits and make any necessary adjustments.

+2: Much greater than the expected outcome): The individual maintains twice-daily tooth brushing, has significantly improved oral health (as evidenced by a dental check-up), and consistently uses additional oral hygiene methods.
+1: Greater than the expected outcome): The individual not only brushes their teeth twice daily but also adopts additional oral hygiene practices, such as flossing daily or using mouthwash.
0: Expected outcome (i.e. goal achieved): The individual consistently brushes their teeth twice daily, as per the goal.
-1: Less than the expected outcome: The individual brushes their teeth occasionally, but far less than twice daily, showing minimal improvement.
-2: Much less than the expected outcome: The individual rarely or never brushes their teeth, showing no improvement from the baseline.
