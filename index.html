SMART Goal: "For the next three months, I will brush my teeth twice daily, once after breakfast and once before going to bed, to improve my oral hygiene. I will track my progress using a calendar app to ensure I adhere to this routine daily."

Specific: The individual will brush their teeth twice a day, once in the morning and once before going to bed.

Measurable: Progress can be measured by tracking daily brushing on a calendar or a mobile app.

Achievable: The goal is realistic and achievable, considering that it involves a routine task that does not require excessive time or resources.

Relevant: This goal is relevant to the individualâ€™s overall self-care and oral hygiene, which is an important part of personal health.

Time-bound: The individual will aim to consistently follow this routine for a period of three months, after which they will reassess their habits and make any necessary adjustments.

+2 (Much more than expected): The individual maintains twice-daily tooth brushing, has significantly improved oral health (as evidenced by a dental check-up), and consistently uses additional oral hygiene methods.
+1 (More than expected): The individual not only brushes their teeth twice daily but also adopts additional oral hygiene practices, such as flossing daily or using mouthwash.
0 (Expected level of achievement): The individual consistently brushes their teeth twice daily, as per the goal.
-1 (Less than expected): The individual brushes their teeth occasionally, but far less than twice daily, showing minimal improvement.
-2 (Much less than expected): The individual rarely or never brushes their teeth, showing no improvement from the baseline.
